# Terra Language VIM Syntax files
These are the syntax and indent files for VIM to highlight and auto indent [CÃ©u-T (Terra)](http://www.inf.puc-rio.br/~prjterra) code.  
These are not polished at all, but seem to work reasonably well.  

The syntax file was derived from [rodrimc/vim-ceu-syntax](https://github.com/rodrimc/vim-ceu-syntax).  
The indent file was direved from VIM's Lua indent file.

## How to install
Just copy the `ftdetect`, `syntax` and `indent` folders to `~/.vim/`
